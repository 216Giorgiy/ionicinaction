When we build mobile apps, we are building for a touch interface. That means we can't rely on the traditional mouse events such as click and mouseover. Rather we want to be on the lookout for events such as swipe, drag, and taps.

Luckily Ionic has a set of useful features that allow us to easily listen for these events. Ionic has a number of directives you can apply to an element that will be called when the event occurs.

* on-hold
* on-tap
* on-touch
* on-release
* on-drag
* on-drag-up
* on-drag-right
* on-drag-down
* on-drag-left
* on-swipe
* on-swipe-up
* on-swipe-right
* on-swipe-down
* on-swipe-left
