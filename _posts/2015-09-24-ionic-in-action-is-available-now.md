I'm proud to say that the book is ready and available now! The final digital versions are coming out in a few days and the printer is sending the hard copies hot off the press.

I've worked pretty hard on the book and I'm proud of how it has turned out. I have to thank the Ionic team and Manning for all of the help to write and produce this book.

### What about Ionic 2? Should I wait for that?

No. Ionic 2 is a ways away (the Ionic team will inform you it is still a ways off, especially because it also depends on Angular 2 and that is still a ways off) so it does not make sense to wait an unknown amount of time for a future version. What you learn using Ionic 1 will enable you to learn Ionic 2 very quickly, and the basic fundamentals will remain constant. I've been looking at an early preview of Ionic 2, and its going to be awesome, but it doesn't make sense to wait.

I'm sure many of you are also wondering if there will be an update when Ionic 2 comes out. Rest assured, I hope to make the update when that happens. However, it will not be for a while so until then go ahead and work with Ionic 1. It is the best mobile framework out there today, so let me know what you build!
