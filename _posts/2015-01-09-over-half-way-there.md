I wanted to provide a quick update on the status of the book. The book is over half way done, and I'm nearly done with chapter 6 and have planned to finish chapter 7 by mid January. Chapter 3 was recently completed, which is an Angular primer for those who are need to Angular. Chapters 4-6 are my favorite since they focus on building three pretty neat apps using Ionic's components and structure. Chapter 7 will provide a number of advanced techniques to improve your apps.

Today, Jan 9, Ionic is one of the [featured books on Manning's Deal of the Day](http://www.manning.com/wilken?a_aid=ionicinaction). If you have some money burning a hole in your pocket, I would be honored if you grabbed a copy.

Looking forward, chapter 8 will dig deeper into Cordova and how to leverage ngCordova in order to integrate your app deeper with the device. Chapter 9 will cover testing and debugging techniques that will empower you to develop with confidence. Lastly, chapter 10 will focus on taking your finished app and getting it published to the App Store and Play Store.

Thanks for all of the support thus far, and if you do grab a copy please connect on the author forums and let me know how you like it!
