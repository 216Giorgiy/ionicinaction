I'm happy to introduce the official site for the upcoming book "Ionic in Action - Hybrid Mobile Apps with Ionic and AngularJS", about the amazing Ionic Framework. It will empower you to create beautiful mobile apps using the technologies you already know to build web applications.

The upcoming book Ionic in Action - Hybrid Mobile Apps with Ionic and AngularJS is a guide to building mobile apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The Ionic Framework is a hybrid app framework built with AngularJS.

I will regularly be sharing some insights into the Ionic Framework, tips, and progress on the book. Follow on Twitter, or via RSS to keep up with updates!
